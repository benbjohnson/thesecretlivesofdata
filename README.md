## Overview

Here I'm adapting similar visualizations to Neo4js Bolt protocol, and in particular to the Bolt Routing protocol, used with Neo4j Causal Clusters.


## Visualizations


1. Overview. Why do we need a routing protocol?

2. Bolt + Routing : How it works.

3. Initial Address Resolution. Three options : DNS round-robin, Load Balancer & Resolver function.

4. [Next?] Server-side routing

5. [Next?] Server groups & Routing policies
